DeepSource is where I work at, build most of what I build at. June 2021 is when we launched a completely new UI for the platform. This was a monumental shift in our design and the direction of the product. The focus was to make sure developers have a frictionless experience when using the product to identify issues with the pull requests as well as to show appropraite metrics and trends wherever relevant.
