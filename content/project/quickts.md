QuickTS is an attempt to buld a faster toolchain for TypeScript projects. It's a work in progress and still not ready for production.

# Zero config, productivity focused

- **Fastest Possible Toolchain** — QuickTS uses ESBuild under the hood, ensuring lightning fast dev builds

- **DeepSource for Code Quality** — DeepSource helps you write clean code on every pull-request.

- **Github Actions for testing and publishing** — Preset Action for you to test and publish instantly.

- **API Docs using TypeDoc** — Automatically convert comments in TypeScript source code into rendered HTML documentation.

- **Optional CSS Bundling** — Optionally enable CSS bundling for UI libraries

- **And much more** — QuickTS bootstraps your project with Jest for testing, Prettier and ESLint for maintaing consistent style.
